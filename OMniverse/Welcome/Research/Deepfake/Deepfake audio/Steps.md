Technical Specification for Voice Replacement in Audio File

Objective:
Complete replacement of the woman’s voice in the audio file “Miranda.m4a” with the woman’s voice used in 12 examples titled “Example Neptun”, while preserving all other characteristics of the original audio.

1. Analysis of Source Data

1. Source File:
• Name: Miranda.m4a
• Duration: 49 seconds.
• Contains a dialogue between a man and a woman.
• Experimental nature of the recording (includes the command “Start” at the beginning).
2. Target Voice for Replacement:
• 12 examples of “Example Neptun”, featuring the same female voice.
• Requires extraction of the clean female voice from the examples, removing background noise.

2. Key Tasks

1. Extracting the Target Voice:
• Clean the “Example Neptun” samples to remove background noise while preserving the natural characteristics of the voice.
• Prepare the voice for replacement by creating a profile of its intonation, pitch, and timbre.
2. Replacing the Voice in “Miranda.m4a”:
• Completely replace the woman’s voice in the audio file “Miranda.m4a” with the female voice from “Example Neptun”.
• Preserve the original intonation, rhythm, and emotional nuances of the dialogue.
3. Preserving Other Audio Characteristics:
• Background noise, rustling, and the command “Start” must remain unchanged.
• The male voice in the dialogue should not be altered.

3. Technical Requirements

1. Utilization of Voice Replacement Technology:
• Use advanced voice replacement algorithms (e.g., neural networks or deepfake-audio technologies).
• Account for pitch, intonation, pauses, and other parameters of the original voice.
2. Quality of Output:
• The final file must pass a high-quality assessment.
• Changes must not be detectable through phonoscopic analysis.
3. Output File Format:
• Maintain the original format (.m4a).
• The duration and structure of the audio must match the source file exactly.
4. Quality Control:
• Use automated and manual quality-checking methods to ensure seamless replacement.
• Confirm preservation of background noises and other sounds.
• The quality score should meet the highest standards.

4. Work Stages

1. Audio Analysis:
• Study the structure of the dialogue in “Miranda.m4a”.
• Prepare the voice from “Example Neptun” for replacement.
2. Voice Cleaning and Preparation:
• Remove background noise from the examples.
• Create an adapted voice profile.
3. Voice Replacement:
• Replace the woman’s voice in “Miranda.m4a”.
• Adjust parameters such as timbre, pitch, and intonation.
4. Final Quality Check:
• Test the output for phonoscopic quality.
• Compare with the original file to ensure no noticeable alterations.
5. File Delivery:
• Provide the final file in the original format (.m4a).
• Deliver with a report detailing the changes made.

5. Recommended Technologies

• Neural Networks and Algorithms:
• Tacotron, WaveNet, or other TTS models.
• Voice conversion algorithms (e.g., Respeecher or iZotope).
• Audio Cleaning Tools:
• Adobe Audition, RX 10 Advanced, or equivalent software.

6. Deliverables

• The audio file “Miranda.m4a”, with the woman’s voice replaced by the voice from “Example Neptun”.
• All background noises and the structure of the dialogue are preserved.
• The replacement quality meets the highest standards, with no detectable alterations through phonoscopic analysis.

Noises, dialogue, pauses, as well as other external sounds in the original Miranda file.m4a remains the same, unchanged. In the original, only the voice changes
